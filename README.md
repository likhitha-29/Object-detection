# Object-detection
Object detection is a computer vision technique used to identify and locate objects of interest within an image or a video.It involves two primary tasks: object
localization and object classification.
Object localization aims to determine the bounding box coordinates (usually represented by a rectangle) that tightly enclose the object within the image.It provides 
information about the object's position and size.
Object classification involves identifying the category or class of the object within the bounding box. Commonly used object detection models are trained on large datasets 
and can recognize a wide range of objects, such as cars, people, animals, household items, etc.
